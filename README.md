### Welcome to 30 Yard Screamer!

30 Yard Screamer is a platform to talk and connect with other people around the world about your favorite soccer teams and interact with fellow fans.

Before we even began the project, I knew I wanted to create a soccer blog/social network in which fans could discuss their opinions about their favorite teams.

When a team is clicked on, it will display the team name next to their logo, which a brief description about the team. All of posts that users have written for the team will be displayed below and the page will show who wrote each post and how long ago it was written. Below the body of each post, you can see how many replies each of the posts has received. Above the team name is an 'edit' button which is only available to the website's administrators.

This is a team page with no posts about the team yet. Just simply add a topic and write a question or prompt and wait for others to join the conversation!

## Minimum Viable Product
* Have at least 2 models â€“ one representing someone using your application, and at least one more that represents the main functional idea for your app.
* Include sign up/log in functionality, with authentication. Implement basic authorization by restricting access to certain features, such as editing and deleting a resource, to an authenticated user.
* Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE.
* Have full CRUD for at least one of your resources.
* Have semantically clean HTML and CSS.
* Be deployed online (Heroku) and accessible to the public.

## Bugs Fixes & Future Add-Ons
1. The only bug I have ran into thus far was with the footer. On shorter pages it displays half way up the page but on regular pages it displays at the bottom.
2. I want to add more user page functionality with the ability to add friends and write posts on users' pages.
3. I want to add team favorites for users with a home feed that displays all the recent posts about teams that they have chosen.
4. I also want to add an option to upload profile pictures to the user profiles, but didn't develop the user pages until too late so I didn't have time to get into the AWS.
